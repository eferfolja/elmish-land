# Elmish Land

A framework for building F# browser apps with Fable, React and Elmish. Inspired by [Elm Land](https://elm.land)

## Getting started

### Setup

#### Prerequisites
In order to use Elmish Land you will need the following tools:

* [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) to work with F# files and dependencies
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to execute JS code

### Start a new project
Elmish Land comes with a single dotnet tool to help you create new projects, add features, run your dev server, and more.

#### Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it

```bash
mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject
```

#### Install Elmish Land as a local dotnet tool

```bash
  dotnet new tool-manifest
  dotnet tool install elmish-land --prerelease
```

#### Initialize the project

```bash
  dotnet elmish-land init
```

Every new Elmish Land project is created with these three files:

```bash
MyProject/
    |- package.json         # The Node.js package.json file
    |- global.json          # Dotnet global.json file
    |- MyProject.fsproj     # F# project file
    |- index.html           # App HTML file
    |- src/
        |- Routes.fs        # All routes for our app (autogenerated)
        |- Shared.fs        # Global state for our app 
        |- Pages/
            |- Home
                |- Page.fs  # The homepage for our app
        |- App.fs           # Startup point for our app (autogenerated)
```

#### Running the dev server

The Elmish Land dotnet tool comes with a built in development server. Here's how to run your new project in the web browser:

```bash
dotnet elmish-land server
```

You should see "Home" when you open `http://localhost:1234`
