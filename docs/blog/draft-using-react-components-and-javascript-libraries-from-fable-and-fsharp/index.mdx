title: Using Javascript Libraries and React Components from Fable and F#

[Fable](https://fable.io) is a powerful compiler that transforms your F# code into elegant and performant JavaScript, allowing you to tap into the extensive JavaScript ecosystem while maintaining F#â€™s expressiveness and type safety. In this post, Iâ€™ll explore how to create bindings for both React-specific and basic JavaScript libraries, and then dive into configuring your project file for publishing a Fable-compatible package to NuGet.

## Getting Started with Fable

Fable lets you leverage your F# expertise in a modern web context. By translating F# into clear JavaScript code, it enables you to:
* Utilize your F# skills in building dynamic web applications.
* Access a vast array of JavaScript libraries without sacrificing the safety of F#â€™s type system.
* Build both client-side and server-side applications with a unified codebase.

Whether youâ€™re incorporating interactive user interfaces or integrating general JavaScript functionality, Fable provides a solid bridge between F# and JavaScript.

## Binding Basic JavaScript Libraries

When integrating a standard JavaScript library, your goal is to create bindings that offer type safety and seamless IntelliSense support. [Fableâ€™s interop features](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html), particularly the `import` [attributes](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html#attributes) and [functions](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html#functions), simplify this process. Consider the following example of a naive binding for the [Supabase Javascript Library](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction) library:

```fsharp
namespace Supabase

open Fable.Core
open Fable.Core.JS
open Fable.Core.JsInterop

// highlight-start
[<Erase>]
// highlight-end
type PostgrestError = {
    cause: string
    details: string
    hint: string
    code: string
}

[<Erase>]
type PostgrestSingleResponse<'a> = {
    error: PostgrestError option
    data: 'a option
    count: int option
}

[<Erase>]
type PostgrestFilterBuilder<'a> =
    inherit Promise<PostgrestSingleResponse<'a array>>
    abstract member eq: column: string * value: obj -> PostgrestFilterBuilder<'a>
    abstract member neq: column: string * value: obj -> PostgrestFilterBuilder<'a>

[<Erase>]
type PostgrestQueryBuilder =
    abstract member select: string -> PostgrestFilterBuilder<'a>

[<Erase>]
type SupabaseClient =
    abstract member from: relation: string -> PostgrestQueryBuilder

[<Erase>]
[<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
type Supabase =
    static member createClient (supabaseUrl: string, supabaseKey: string)
        : SupabaseClient =
        // highlight-start
        import "createClient" "@supabase/supabase-js"
        // highlight-end

```

The `[<Erase>]` attribute in Fable is a powerful tool that tells the compiler to omit the annotated types from the final JavaScript output. This means that while these typesâ€”like those for PostgrestError, PostgrestSingleResponse, and othersâ€”exist in your F# code to enforce type safety and provide IntelliSense during development, they vanish at runtime, resulting in lean and efficient JavaScript. Essentially, the types serve as compile-time contracts, ensuring that your interactions with external JavaScript libraries remain error-free without adding extra runtime overhead.

The import function is used to bind F# code to external JavaScript modules. In the snippet, the line
```fsharp
import "createClient" "@supabase/supabase-js"
```
instructs Fable to import the `createClient` export from the `@supabase/supabase-js` package. This allows you to call the external function from your F# code as if it were a native function, while still leveraging F#â€™s robust type system. Combined, the `[<Erase>]` attribute and the import function enable seamless interop between F# and JavaScript, letting you write type-safe F# code that integrates directly with dynamic JavaScript librariesâ€”an approach well-documented in the Fable [Erase features](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html#erase) and the [import features](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html#imports).

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: You will have to install the npm package to your project to use the binding above:
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
````

## Binding React Libraries with Feliz

React is a cornerstone of modern web development, and the Feliz library offers an expressive DSL for building React applications in F#. When creating bindings for React components or utilities, you can follow a similar approach while taking advantage of Felizâ€™s intuitive API. For example:

```fsharp
namespace Feliz.Shadcn

[<AutoOpen>]
module Elements =
    open Fable.Core
    open Fable.Core.JsInterop
    open Feliz

    [<Erase>]
    type Shadcn =
        static member inline accordion (props: list<IReactProperty>) =
            Interop.reactApi.createElement(
                import
                    "Accordion"
                    "@/components/ui/accordion"
                , createObj !!props
            )

```

In this example, the Import attribute is used to bind a default React component from a JavaScript library. The myComponent function then leverages Felizâ€™s React.createElement to instantiate the component with the provided properties, allowing you to integrate and compose your UI with F#â€™s type safety and clarity.
