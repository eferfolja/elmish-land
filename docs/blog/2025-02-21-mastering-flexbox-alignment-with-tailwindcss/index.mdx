Flexbox is one of the most powerful tools in modern CSS, enabling developers to create flexible and
responsive layouts with ease. One of its greatest strengths lies in its alignment capabilities,
allowing precise control over how elements are positioned within a container.

In this guide, I’ll break down Flexbox alignment properties with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com),
ensuring you understand not just how they work, but when to use them effectively. If you're using
[Elmish Land](/) and need help setting it up for Tailwind, you can [read this blog post first](/blog/using-tailwind-css-with-fable-and-elmish)
before continuing.

A great place to try and explore the tailwind utility classes is [the Tailwind Play site](https://play.tailwindcss.com).

## Understanding the Flexbox Axes

Before diving into alignment classes, it’s essential to understand how Flexbox operates:

* **Main Axis** → The direction items flow (`flex-row` = left to right, `flex-col` = top to bottom).
* **Cross Axis** → The perpendicular direction (vertical if `flex-row`, horizontal if `flex-col`).

You can read more about `flex-direction` [in the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction).

Now, let’s explore how to align items using Tailwind’s Flexbox utilities.


## 1. Aligning Items on the Main Axis: `justify-*`

The `justify-*` classes control horizontal alignment in a row (`flex-row`) and vertical alignment in a column (`flex-col`).

### Common Justification Classes:

| Class             | Effect
| ------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
| `justify-start`   | Align items to the start (left in `flex-row`, top in `flex-col`)
| `justify-end`     | Align items to the end (right in `flex-row`, bottom in `flex-col`)
| `justify-center`  | Center items on any axis
| `justify-between` | Spread items evenly, first item at the start, last at the end
| `justify-around`  | Equal space around items
| `justify-evenly`  | Equal space between and outside items

✅ **Use Case**: Centering navigation links in a navbar. [Preview at tailwind play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/vvBhX50fcn)

```html
<nav class="flex justify-between px-4 py-2 bg-gray-800 text-white">
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
  <a href="#">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

You can read more about `justify-content` [in the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/justify-content).


## 2. Aligning Items on the Cross Axis: `items-*`

The `items-*` classes control **vertical alignment** in a row (`flex-row`) and **horizontal alignment** in a column (`flex-col`).

**Common Items Classes:**

| Class	         | Effect
| -------------- | -----------------------------------------------
| `items-start`  | Items align at the top (left in `flex-col`)
| `items-end`    | Items align at the bottom (right in `flex-col`)
| `items-center` | Items align in the middle
| `items-stretch`| Items stretch to fill the container

✅ **Use Case**: Centering content inside a hero section (no wrapping). [Preview at tailwind play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/W6LAqDq6k0)

```html
<section class="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gray-200">
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome</h1>
</section>
````

You can read more about `align-items` [in the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/align-items).


## 3. Aligning a Single Item Differently: `self-*`

If you want only one item to have a different alignment than the rest, use `self-*`.

**Common Self Classes:**

| Class	         | Effect
| -------------- | ---------------
| `self-start`   | Aligns one item at the start
| `self-end`     | Aligns one item at the end
| `self-center`  | Centers one item
| `self-stretch` | Stretches one item

✅ *Use Case*: A single item in a list behaving differently. [Preview at tailwind play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/rnWafb78IZ)

```html
<ul class="flex gap-2 h-50 bg-amber-100">
  <li class="bg-blue-500 p-2">Item 1</li>
  <li class="bg-red-500 p-2 self-end">Item 2</li>
</ul>
````

You can read more about `align-self` [in the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/align-self).


## 4. Controlling Multi-Row Alignment: `content-*`

If you have multiple rows or columns (when using `flex-wrap`), use `content-*` to align them.

#### Common Multi-Row Alignment Classes:

| Class	            | Effect
| ----------------- | --------------------------
| `content-start`   | Rows stack at the top
| `content-end`     | Rows stack at the bottom
| `content-center`  | Rows are centered
| `content-between` | Rows spread out evenly
| `content-around`  | Rows get equal space around them

✅ *Use Case*: Aligning Wrapped Flex Items in the Center. [Preview at tailwind play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/OArJZRVBMD)

```html
<div class="flex flex-wrap content-center h-96 bg-gray-300">
  <div class="w-32 h-32 bg-blue-500"></div>
  <div class="w-32 h-32 bg-red-500"></div>
  <div class="w-32 h-32 bg-green-500"></div>
</div>
```

You can read more about `align-content` [in the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/align-content).


## Cheat Sheet

| Tailwind Class | Axis                   | Effect
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------
| `justify-*`    | Main Axis              | Controls **left-to-right** (or **top-to-bottom** in column mode) alignment
| `items-*`      | Cross Axis             | Controls **vertical alignment** (or **horizontal in column mode**)
| `self-*`       | Cross Axis             | Controls **alignment of a single item**
| `content-*`    | Cross Axis (with wrap) | Controls **multi-row or multi-column spacing**


## Final Thoughts

Many developers find Flexbox confusing at first, but once you break it down into ***alignment along two axes***, it becomes
much easier to understand. Tailwind CSS simplifies this process by [providing intuitive utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-direction)
that eliminate the need to memorize complex CSS rules. Instead of struggling with `display: flex;` and various alignment properties,
you can quickly apply `justify-*`, `items-*`, and `self-*` to get the exact layout you need.

The key to mastering Flexbox is practice—experiment with different alignment classes, play around with `flex-row` vs. `flex-col`,
and observe how items behave. Once it clicks, you’ll realize how powerful and flexible it really is. And with Tailwind,
you can skip the frustration and focus on building responsive, clean layouts faster than ever.
