title: Introducing Feliz.Shadcn: Effortless UI Design for F# devs
authors: [klofberg]

In today’s fast-paced development landscape, creating modern, responsive user interfaces can be difficult. 
With the release of Feliz.Shadcn, developers can now leverage the powerful capabilities of F# and Fable while tapping 
into the rich ecosystem of the [shadcn/ui component library](https://ui.shadcn.com/). This new dotnet 
package provides type-safe bindings for Shadcn’s pre-styled components, enabling F# developers to craft elegant UIs 
without the steep learning curve often associated with CSS and traditional frontend design.

## What is Feliz.Shadcn?

Feliz.Shadcn is a new library with [Feliz](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/) style typings allowing you to build F#/Fable 
apps that utilize the shadcn/ui component library. By providing F#-friendly typings, Feliz.Shadcn makes it simple to use 
Shadcn components directly in your code. This not only accelerates development but also ensures that your UIs are consistent, modern, and maintainable.
