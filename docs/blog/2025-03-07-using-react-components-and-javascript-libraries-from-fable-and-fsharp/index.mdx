title: Using React Components and Javascript Libraries from Fable and F#

[Fable](https://fable.io) is a powerful compiler that transforms your F# code into elegant and performant JavaScript, allowing you to tap into the extensive JavaScript ecosystem while maintaining F#’s expressiveness and type safety. In this post, I’ll explore how to create bindings for both React-specific and basic JavaScript libraries, and then dive into configuring your project file for publishing a Fable-compatible package to NuGet.

## Getting Started with Fable

Fable lets you leverage your F# expertise in a modern web context. By translating F# into clear JavaScript code, it enables you to:
* Utilize your F# skills in building dynamic web applications.
* Access a vast array of JavaScript libraries without sacrificing the safety of F#’s type system.
* Build both client-side and server-side applications with a unified codebase.

Whether you’re incorporating interactive user interfaces or integrating general JavaScript functionality, Fable provides a solid bridge between F# and JavaScript.

## Binding Basic JavaScript Libraries

When integrating a standard JavaScript library, your goal is to create bindings that offer type safety and seamless IntelliSense support. [Fable’s interop features](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html), particularly the `import` [attributes](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html#attributes) and [functions](https://fable.io/docs/javascript/features.html#functions), simplify this process. Consider the following example for a binding in the [Elmish.Toastr](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Elmish.Toastr/) library:

```fsharp
open Fable.Core
open Fable.Core.JsInterop

let private successToastWithTitle (msg: string) (title: string) (options: ToastrOptions) : unit = import "success" "toastr"
```

In this snippet, the Import attribute instructs Fable to connect the F# value with the corresponding JavaScript module export. The type signature enforces that F# treats it as a function taking an integer and returning an integer, providing compile-time assurances.
