![EIntro](./intro.webp)

Elmish Land is a modern framework designed for F# developers who want to build scalable, maintainable, and type-safe frontend web applications with ease.
Inspired by [Elm Land](https://elm.land/), it abstracts away many of the complexities often associated with using F#, [Fable](https://fable.io/), and 
[Elmish](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/), allowing developers to focus on 
building great user experiences with minimal boilerplate.

## Pages as the Building Blocks

In Elmish Land, [pages](/docs/core-concepts/pages) serve as the core components of your application. The framework features a file-system-based router, where directories inside 
the `src/Pages` folder define URL routes automatically. For example, adding a folder named `src/Pages/About` with a `Page.fs` file will map directly 
to the `/about` route.

This structure provides a clear, intuitive way to organize your code, eliminating the need for manually defining route mappings and ensuring 
consistency across your application.

## Type-Safe Routing

Elmish Land brings [type safety to route and query parameters](/docs/core-concepts/routing#type-safe-routing) through a `route.json` file. This approach guarantees that all parameters are correctly 
typed and parsed, reducing runtime errors and improving overall code reliability. By enforcing compile-time safety, developers can confidently 
refactor routes without introducing breaking changes.


## Shared State Management

Managing global application state is simplified with [SharedModel](/docs/core-concepts/shared), which acts as a central store for data accessible across all pages. This shared state 
approach helps maintain consistency, reduces redundant data fetching, and makes it easier to share information between different components of the application.

## Layouts and Commands

Elmish Land provides built-in support for [layouts](/docs/core-concepts/layouts), enabling developers to create reusable UI structures for different sections of their application. 
Additionally, its approach to command handling ensures that side effects, such as API calls or state updates, are managed predictably.

By combining these features, Elmish Land streamlines frontend development in F#, making it more intuitive, efficient, and robust.


## Why Choose Elmish Land?

Whether you're an experienced F# developer or just starting with frontend development, Elmish Land provides a structured and scalable approach 
to building web applications. With type safety, built-in state management, and predictable routing, it removes much of the friction in frontend development, 
allowing you to focus on creating great user experiences rather than fighting with configuration.
