Elmish Land takes Elmish’s elegant Model–View–Update architecture and removes much of the boilerplate you’d normally
write when handling routing and page navigation. In this post, we’ll explore how to build a simple multi-page application
using Elmish Land’s built‐in routing capabilities. We’ll create a two–page application (Home and About) and see
how Elmish Land automatically wires up URL parsing and navigation for you.

You can learn more and dive deeper in the [documentation](/docs/core-concepts/pages).

## File-based routing

With Elmish Land’s file-based routing, your pages are determined by their location and name in your project.
For example, if you create a file structure like this:

```bash
src/
 └── Pages/
      ├── Home.fs
      └── About.fs
```

Elmish Land will automatically use:
*	Pages/Home.fs -> Route: /
*	Pages/About.fs -> Route: /about

That’s it! No attributes, no union type for pages - just plain file organization. The framework will generate the code
that parses the URL and calls the correct page initialization, update, and view functions.

## Defining the about page

Let’s start by adding our `About` page. In a real application, you might add more logic or styling, but for our example we’ll keep it simple.

The following command will scaffold the page for you:

```bash
dotnet elmish-land add page "/About"
```

We need to manually add the about page to the project file `PagesAndNavigation.fsproj`:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    ...
    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="src/Shared.fs"/>
        <Compile Include="src/Pages/NotFound.fs"/>
        <Compile Include="src/Pages/Layout.fs"/>
        <Compile Include="src/Pages/Page.fs"/>
        // highlight-start
        <Compile Include="src/Pages/About/Page.fs" />
        // highlight-end
    </ItemGroup>
    ...
</Project>
```

Elmish Land automatically associates the `/about` route with the About page.

## Navigating to the abount page
