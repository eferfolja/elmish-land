# Introduction

## What is Elmish Land?

In the JavaScript ecosystem, the idea of an "application framework" is pretty common. In the React community, one popular framework is called Next.js. In the Vue.js community, you'll find a similar framework called Nuxt.

These frameworks help take care of the common questions you might encounter when getting started with a new project. They also include helpful guides and learning resources throughout your personal journey.

Elmish Land is no different! But instead of building apps in Javascript, you'll be using something different: F# and Elmish!
